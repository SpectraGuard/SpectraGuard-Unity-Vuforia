SpectraGuard-Unity-Vuforia
In this project, we tested the functionality of the Vuforia Engine. Since the Unity project is too large to upload here, here are the key aspects:

Cbau:
This is a scene in which we added the scanned Area Targets and placed AR content at points of interest like rooms and fire alarms. We implemented a simple navigation system, but it still has bugs.

Demo:
We scanned the university again for the demo because the room was set up differently.

Instructions
Follow this tutorial to set up the Vuforia Engine in your Unity project:
