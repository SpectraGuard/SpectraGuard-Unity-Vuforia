# SpectraGuard-Unity-Vuforia

In this Project we Tested out the functionality of the Vuforia Engine. Since the Unity Project is to big to upload here are the key aspects. 

Cbau: 
This is a Scene in which we added the Scaned AreaTargets and PlacedAR Content at POI of interest like Roooms and Firealarms. We implemented a simple Naviagation System but its still bugged.  

Demo: 
We scanned the University again for the Demo, because the Room was setup diffrently.
